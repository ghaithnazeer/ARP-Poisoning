# ARP-Poisoning
This project detects ARP posoning through the usage of deep learning and neural networks, enhancing netwrok security by addressing the growing usage of interconnected devices and preventing digital threats. 
# Dataset
This project uses ARP_Dataset.csv, a real-world network dataset, to train and evaluate a deep learning model. The dataset includes features like MAC addresses, IP addresses, ARP opcodes, packet rates, and switch IDs and network ports. It provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding network behavior and anomalies.
# Deep Learning Architecture
The project uses a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to detect ARP poisoning with exceptional accuracy. CNNs extract intricate features from sequential data, identifying subtle patterns and anomalies, while LSTMs capture long-term dependencies within data sequences. This combination of features and temporal sensitivity allows for efficient identification of even the most discreet ARP poisoning attacks, enhancing the overall accuracy of the detection process.
